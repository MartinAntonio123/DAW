            ¿Qué alternativas a jQuery existen?

        <p>
            Prototype <br>
            Prototype is a javascript library that is not as popular JQuery but is comprehensively used in some popular applications (such as Ruby on Rails). It provides an Ajax framework as well as other utilities as part of its framework. It also handles the XMLHttpRequest protocol which allows dynamic web pages without requiring the browser to reload the entire page. <br>

            Ext<br>
            Ext is similar to JQuery and Prototype providing the same functionality using different syntax, the DOM model can be accessed using the Ext framework as well as Ajax applications can be developed. It is compatible with JQuery and Prototype even though it is an entirely different library. Ext is very easy to use as it has predefined UI objects that can be instantly called into a web page, these controls include text areas, toolbars and radio buttons among several others.<br>

            Dojo Toolkit<br>
            Dojo is advertised as more of a 'toolkit' than a library or javascript framework itself but it qualifies as a suitable alternative to JQuery. It is opensource and consists of several javascript and Ajax based applets for immediate use. Their components allow you to create objects instantly which are complete, coded with HTML, CSS and javascript and sometimes Ajax as well.<br>

            MooTools<br>
            MooTools is a relatively new javascript library that is slowly appearing in the web development scene, it has gained popularity in recent times with a considerable amount of plugins developed using MooTools for the popular Wordpress blogging platform. Other popular internet brands using MooTools include Bing and Joomla.<br>

            Script.aculo.us<br>
            Script.aculo.us is built on the Prototype framework but it is a separate Javascript library in itself, script.aculo.us is mainly known for its use in the popular Ruby on Rails platform. A great feature bundled with this library is the effects that can be instantly applied to objects in a web page using the DOM.<br>
